      2 			note	Part of a stress-induced multi-chaperone system, it is involved in the recovery of the cell from heat-induced damage, in cooperation with DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE. Acts before DnaK, in the processing of protein aggregates. Protein binding stimulates the ATPase activit; ATP hydrolysis unfolds the denatured protein aggregates, which probably helps expose new hydrophobic binding sites on the surface of ClpB-bound aggregates, contributing to the solubilization and refolding of denatured protein aggregates by DnaK (By similarity); Belongs to the ClpA/ClpB family
      2 			note	Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins, in association with DnaK and GrpE. It is the nucleotide exchange factor for DnaK and may function as a thermosensor. Unfolded proteins bind initially to Dna; upon interaction with the DnaJ-bound protein, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from Dna; ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP- dependent interactions between DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE are required for fully efficient folding; Belongs to the GrpE family
      2 			note	Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins and by disaggregating proteins, also in an autonomous, DnaK-independent fashion. Unfolded proteins bind initially to Dna; upon interaction with the DnaJ-bound protein, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from Dna; ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE are required for fully efficient folding. Also involved, together with DnaK and GrpE, in the DNA replication of plasmids through activation of initiation proteins; Belongs to the DnaJ family; Contains 1 CR-type zinc finger; Contains 1 J domain

      1 			function	Part of a stress-induced multi-chaperone system, it is involved in the recovery of the cell from heat-induced damage, in cooperation with DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE. Acts before DnaK, in the processing of protein aggregates. Protein binding stimulates the ATPase activity; ATP hydrolysis unfolds the denatured protein aggregates, which probably helps expose new hydrophobic binding sites on the surface of ClpB-bound aggregates, contributing to the solubilization and refolding of denatured protein aggregates by DnaK (By similarity). Required for colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, probably due to protection from a combination of stress factors.

      1 			function	Participates actively in the response to hyperosmotic and heat shock by preventing the aggregation of stress-denatured proteins, in association with DnaK and GrpE. It is the nucleotide exchange factor for DnaK and may function as a thermosensor. Unfolded proteins bind initially to DnaJ; upon interaction with the DnaJ-bound protein, DnaK hydrolyzes its bound ATP, resulting in the formation of a stable complex. GrpE releases ADP from DnaK; ATP binding to DnaK triggers the release of the substrate protein, thus completing the reaction cycle. Several rounds of ATP-dependent interactions between DnaJ, DnaK and GrpE are required for fully efficient folding
